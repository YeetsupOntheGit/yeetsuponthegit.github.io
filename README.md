# Lol this is my website

it uses the [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com "google fonts this way") library that way it can load fonts without needing the user to have them installed. ~~It also uses a [live markdown translator](https://md-block.verou.me/ "its called 'md-block'. We stopped using it because it doesnt work on older devices.") for quality-of-life and to edit pages faster~~ I stopped using a live MD translator, as it does not work on older systems. See, my mission is to create a meme site that can be quickly accessed on almost any device with a web browser, new *and* old. To keep things simple, I'm trying to use code compatible with at least any old windows XP, OS X, iOS 6 >, and Android 4 >.
